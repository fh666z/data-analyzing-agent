Project Description,it,"The Bike Lights That Think, Not Just Shine

We are Veloneer — a cycling safety revolution born from our love of riding and decades of experience in automotive design. Cycling isn’t just what we do, it’s how we live — and now that we share it with our children, safety has become our top priority.

For us, a bike light should do much more than just shine. Here are some of the intelligent features that make Veloneer truly unique:

AI-Driven Adaptive Lighting
Automatically adjusts beam intensity when braking or accelerating, ensuring optimal visibility and safety.

High Brightness
Front LEDs provide 1,200 lumens in low- and high-beam modes, with a boost to 2,400 lumens for off-road use, offering clear vision on city streets and dark trails.

Epic Battery Life
The front light lasts up to 125 hours and the rear light up to 120 hours in Eco mode. Recharge easily with fast USB-C charging.

StVZO-Compliant Beam
Meets strict German road safety standards with a precise, anti-glare beam and dedicated lights for 360° visibility during nighttime rides.

Versatile Power Options
Integrates with e-bike systems and can draw power from your e-bike's battery, making it perfect for long-distance rides.

Waterproof Durability
Designed to withstand heavy rain and mud, ensuring reliability in all weather conditions.

Ultimate Rider Control
Features a handlebar remote and smartphone app for hands-free operation, allowing you to switch modes and adjust brightness safely and conveniently.

Speed & Cadence Sensor Sync
Syncs with your bike’s sensors to automatically adjust modes based on your pace, optimizing illumination and battery use.

All that in one system - Veloneer AI Smart Bicycle Lights — a connected bundle that includes front and rear smart lights, a speed/cadence sensor, and a remote control. They all work together with AI-powered intelligence, adapting to speed, motion, and riding conditions to deliver rides that are smarter, safer, and greener.

Our goal is straightforward: to bring automotive-grade technology to cycling at an accessible price for every rider, backed by the expertise to achieve it.

Project Description,it,"With your backing, we’ll complete the final steps to bring Veloneer to life:

- Tooling - precision moulds for manufacturing.
- Certification - ensuring safety and compliance for global launch.

Once funded, you won’t have to wait long — backers will receive production-ready products just four months after the campaign ends.

Every pledge is more than support — it’s a step toward redefining cycling safety worldwide.",
Project Description,it,"Veloneer is created by SciTech Factory Ltd., a team of 10 experts with 20+ years each in automotive product development, design, and marketing. We’ve built technology for some of the most demanding industries — and now we’re channelling that knowledge into something deeply personal: keeping cyclists and their families safe on every ride.

We’re not just engineers. We’re also parents, commuters, and lifelong riders who believe the future of cycling should be safer, smarter, and more sustainable.

Our Mission: to translate cutting-edge engineering into cycling. 

Our Vision: a new era of rider-first technology. 

And we’re proud to share that SciTech Factory, owner of the Veloneer brand, is supported by the Norway Grants 2014–2021 under the Business Development, Innovation, and SMEs Programme Bulgaria, Support for Start-ups. This backing gives us a strong foundation — and with your help, we can launch Veloneer for riders everywhere.

Thank you for joining us on this journey to improve cycling safety. 
Together, let’s illuminate the way to safer rides for everyone!",
Project Description,it,Thank you for your incredible support — your belief in this project is what keeps it moving forward!,
Impact & Challenges,it,"Cycling isn’t just about speed — it’s about confidence. That’s why we designed the Veloneer AI 360 Smart Cycling System: not just lights, but an integrated safety solution. With adaptive beams, 360° visibility, and crash-prevention intelligence, Veloneer addresses the leading causes of cycling accidents — poor visibility and solo crashes — making every ride more innovative, safer, and more empowering.",
Impact & Challenges,it,"We aim to certify the Veloneer AI 360 Smart Cycling System with the following certificates: StVZO, CE, UKCA, FCC (for the US).",
Impact & Challenges,it,"Our project enhances cyclists' safety and promotes a healthy lifestyle. By utilising AI-driven lights to improve visibility and prevent accidents, we reduce the risk of cycling injuries and fatalities. Safer rides enable more people to confidently choose cycling for exercise and transportation, helping to mitigate sedentary habits and support overall well-being.",
Impact & Challenges,it,"We promote clean energy use by maximising efficiency and supporting low-carbon transport. Our lights operate on long-lasting, rechargeable batteries, reducing waste from disposable batteries. Cycling utilises renewable human energy, making transport more energy-efficient. By encouraging biking over fuel-powered trips, we help decrease reliance on non-renewable energy.",
Impact & Challenges,it,"If successful, our venture will generate new jobs (we plan to hire at least ten employees) and boost economic activity through manufacturing and sales. The cycling sector is recognised for high job creation; it produces more jobs per unit of investment than other transport industries. By expanding this innovative cycling technology, we support sustainable economic growth and offer fair employment opportunities.",
Impact & Challenges,it,"Our project promotes innovation in the cycling industry by integrating predictive AI technology into bike lighting. This state-of-the-art system (with adaptive beams, 360° visibility, and intelligent brake/turn signals and cornering lights) advances cycling safety. Such innovation aligns with sustainable infrastructure aims, as smarter cycling technology supports resilient, high-tech transport systems for the future.",
Impact & Challenges,it,"By improving cycling safety, we help cities become more sustainable and liveable. Our intelligent lighting reduces accidents, making streets safer for cyclists and all road users. This encourages more people to cycle, which decreases traffic congestion and pollution. Ultimately, increasing cycling helps create cities that are more inclusive, safe, and resilient, while promoting community health and connectivity.",
Impact & Challenges,it,"We design our product with sustainability at its centre. All units use rechargeable batteries and energy-efficient electronics, significantly reducing waste from single-use batteries. We also utilise recyclable materials and build for durability, ensuring a longer product lifespan. By minimising waste and using sustainable materials, our project exemplifies responsible production and consumption.",
Impact & Challenges,it,"Our project actively supports climate action by promoting zero-emission transportation. Each time a cyclist rides instead of driving, greenhouse gas emissions are avoided. By making cycling safer, our AI lighting system encourages more people to choose bikes, directly reducing carbon footprints. In this way, the bicycle, empowered by our technology, becomes a powerful tool for combating climate change.",
Impact & Challenges,it,"We’ve made significant progress, but like any ambitious project, challenges still exist. Manufacturing: We partnered with trusted suppliers and completed DFM to enable reliable scaling. Supply chain: multiple suppliers and buffer periods help reduce risk. AI calibration: fine-tuning continues to guarantee smooth, adaptive performance. Expect polished results, transparency, and regular updates driven by your feedback.",
faq,it,How does Veloneer’s AI-driven adaptive lighting actually work?,
faq,it,"Veloneer uses built-in sensors to detect your speed, braking, and acceleration. The lights then adjust brightness, beam angle, and intensity in real-time — keeping you visible when it matters most, without you having to lift a finger.",
faq,it,What differentiates Veloneer from other 'smart' bike lights available?,
faq,it,"While most lights only increase brightness, Veloneer thinks beyond that. With AI-driven adaptation, speed sensor integration, and rider-first design, Veloneer offers not just visibility but also anticipation — helping you stay safer, ride further, and explore with confidence.",
